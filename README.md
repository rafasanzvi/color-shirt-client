<!--DESCRIPTION-->
<p>
This project was done in just 2 week as part of our web development Bootcamp assignments at Ironhack and it was my first project in solitary. Requirements: create an app just using JavaScript, HTML, CSS, NodeJS, Express, MongoDB, REACT and React-Bootstrap an homemade internal API Rest about users and shirts.
  
The project is based on an business model in which the user registers and pays a subscription, thanks to which every month he/she will receive a random Policroma T-shirt at home.
 
The user can choose his or her favourites from the gallery of shirts if he or she wants to receive a special one.
